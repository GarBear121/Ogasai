                                     Ogasai Scripts - Updates to Logitechs original work

## Core files have been changed! For these to work properly you must download the entire script and core folder. You can make a backup of your old ones!

 Any bugs reports are greatly appreciated and will help with the process!

    NOTE - If you open the follower.lua it is probably best to open it with visual studio CODE. There is something odd about it....
    
     combat scripts change depending on spells available. i.e. a priest without shadowform will not see shadowform spells.
     
     Bot now checks for line of sight of target before casting. Bot will no longer cast through walls, hills, etc. More human-like behavior. 
     
     
     
     warlock currently broken under level 4 ( needs a pet to work )
