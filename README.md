  Changes are too numerous to report. The original design, combat and rest and targeting system, is based on Logitechs original scripts. 

    some of the updates inlcuded are...
    
    
     combat scripts change depending on spells available. i.e. a priest without shadowform will not see shadowform spells
     
     
     combat scripts updates for all talent specs/ added new spells/ added many many features
            combat scripts are no longer the same
            
     
     bot checks for line of sight before targeting
        this includes an updated nav system which "tracks" and follows the targets movement and adjusts accordingly
        
     
     follower script is 75% complete with all classes that can heal having heals available except shaman
     
     
     updated and added paranoia features
     
     
     gatherer updates
     
     
     tank rotations
     
     
     follower effectively attacks and assists in combat
     
     
     current scripts are optimized for Twow
